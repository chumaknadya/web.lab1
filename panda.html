       Giant pandas have a bear like appearance. Their distinctive black and white colouring makes them one of the best-known species 
       in the world. They can reach 6 ft (1.9 m) in height and in the wild weigh around 220–250 lb (110–115 kg), although adult males
       can weigh up to 350 lbs (160 kg).

    <h5>Amazing Facts About the Pandas</h5>
    <ul class="list">
      <li> Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their
         eyes six to eight weeks after birth.</li>
      <li> Giant pandas (often referred to as simply “pandas”) are black and white bears. In the wild, they are found in thick bamboo forests, 
        high up in the mountains of central China</li>
      <li>These guys are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>
      <li> The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”.</li>
      <li> Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg. Scientists aren’t sure how long pandas live in the wild, 
        but in captivity they live to be around 30 years old.</li>
      <li>Family time! Female pandas give birth to one or two cubs every two years. Cubs stay with their mothers for 18 months before venturing 
        off on their own!</li>
      <li>Sadly, these beautiful bears are endangered, and it’s estimated that only around 1,000 remain in the wild. That’s why we need to
         do all we can to protect them!</li>
