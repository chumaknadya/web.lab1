      The dog is one of the most popular pets in the world. It ordinarily remains loyal to a considerate master, 
      and because of this the dog has been called man's best friend. Class distinctions between people have no part 
      in a dog's life. It can be a faithful companion to either rich or poor.

  <h5>Amazing Facts About the Dog (Domesticated)</h5>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>  Evidence based on behaviour, vocalisations, morphology, and molecular biology, 
      has led to the current widely accepted scientific understanding that all breeds of domestic dog have descended from the grey wolf.</li>
    <li> Humans and dogs have co-evolved through living together for over 12,000 thousand years. While clearly humans have significantly 
      impacted on the evolution of dogs through selective breeding, the intimate presence of dogs in human culture has also impacted on the evolution of humans.</li>
    <li> Dogs have their own in individual personalities.</li>
    <li> Dogs ave a very high degree of social intelligence. They learn in a variety of different ways such as reinforcement or through 
      observing the behaviour of other dogs, and even humans. They go through a series of cognitive development stages, just like humans.</li>
    <li>Human faces are known to be asymmetrical, with people instinctively moving their gaze to the right side of a face when they meet 
      someone and try to discern their emotional state. Dogs have developed the same instinct when encountering a human, despite the fact
       that they do not do this when meeting other dogs. No other non-primate is known to do this.</li>
    <li>Dogs have been shown to display a range of complex emotions, including optimism, pessimism, depression and jealousy.</li>
    <li>Scientists believe dogs show empathy for others.</li>
