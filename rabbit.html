    <h3>What do rabbits look like?</h3>
      <p>Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae. 
      They have long ears, up to 4 in (10 cm) long, and powerful hind legs. Size varies, with European rabbits ranging from 13–20 in (34–50 cm)
       in length, and weighing between 2.4 and 5.5 lb (1.1–2.5 kg).

    <h3>Where do wild rabbits live?</h3>
      <p>Wild rabbits live in areas where they can dig burrows. They are found in a variety of habitats including meadows, woods, forests, grasslands,
       deserts, and wetlands. Over 50% of wild rabbits live in North America, but they are also found in southwest Europe, Southeast Asia, Sumatra, japan, 
       Africa, and South America.

    <h3>Where do rabbits sleep?</h3>
      <p>
      In the wild, rabbits live in warrens comprising an intricate series of underground tunnels or burrows with multiple entrances.
      </p>
    <h3>Are rabbits sociable?</h3>
      <p>Rabbits are sociable animals that live with other individuals in warrens. They are hierarchical, so one female rabbit is dominant; 
      males will also form a hierarchy. The dominant rabbit enjoys many benefits. They get the best burrows, first dibs on food and can 
      request grooming from other rabbits.</p>
